            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
              We started this journey as passionate pet lovers who wanted the
              best for our dog Max and our cat Luna. Like many pet owners, we
              struggled to find products that were safe, trusted, and truly
              helpful. That's why we created Pawvaro ‚Äî to help you find the best
              for your furry family.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, we partner with top-rated brands and carefully select
              products based on quality, safety, and real customer feedback.
              Every recommendation you see here is researched, tested, and
              approved by pet lovers who care as much as you do.
